To start Mongo, open a terminal shell and enter:
  mongod

Leave that shell running and open another terminal shell tab and enter:
  mongo

The first command starte the mongo daemon (hence the d at the end of the command for daemon).  The second command starts 
the mongo shell where you can interact with MongoDB.  When you enter the shell like this, you'll get a prompt that looks like:
  >
  
Here are two useful commands to try out first:
  > db.help()

This will give you help for database (db) commands. Try this next:
  > db.getCollectionNames()

This shows you any collections you have in the current database.  Lets create a collection and add a document to it.  First:
  > db.createCollection("people")
  
Creates a collection named people.  Now:
  > db.people.insert({"firstName":"Bill", "lastName":"Kunneke", "email":"Bill@TheKunnekes.Com", "twitterHandle":"@BKunneke", 
  "skills":["Java", "C#", "MongoDB", "SQL Server", "MySQL", "PostGRES"]})

This inserts a new document (a record in SQL terms) into the new collection.  The insert requires a valid JSON document, my
example is a document about me.  Now run:
  > db.people.count()
  > db.people.help()

The first command shows you how many documents are in the colleciton, just one for now.  The second shows you help for the
collection, what you do with your people collection.  Now try:
  > db.people.find()

You'll see the document emitted back, but it's a little hard to read so try this now:
  > db.people.find().pretty()

Pretty is a helper function that cleans up the output making it easier to read.
