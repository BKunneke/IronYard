To start Mongo, open a terminal shell and enter:
  mongod

Leave that shell running and open another terminal shell tab and enter:
  mongo

The first command starte the mongo daemon (hence the d at the end of the command for daemon).  The second command starts 
the mongo shell where you can interact with MongoDB.  When you enter the shell like this, you'll get a prompt that looks like:
  >
  
Here are two useful commands to try out first:
  > db.help()

This will give you help for database (db) commands.  You'll notice one command I'd like you to try next:
  > db.getCollectionNames()
